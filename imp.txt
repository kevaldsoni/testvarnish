Welcome to the team again.

My name is Kiril Minanov and I have been working a little on the imatrix project in the last month or so
My skype is "kiril.minanov.gigavoice" and you already have my email.
Let me know when you are online in case you have any questions

This is the project git lab url
https://gitlab.git.internetbrands.com/imatrix/imatrix_corp

You can find all the git related info on gitlab as mentioned above by Alfredo

GIT repo
SSH: git@git.internetbrands.com:imatrix/imatrix_corp.git
HTTPS: https://username@git.internetbrands.com/imatrix/imatrix_corp.git

What I just did was I took the code and the DB from PRD because the PRD code and DB were different than the DEV version we have
For this project we have a DEV and a STG environment as well. We are not using the STG environment at the moment

We are using only the DEV environment for development
This is the URL for the DEV environment
http://dev-www.imatrix.com
http://dev-www.imatrix.com/wp-admin
The dev version should have the same credentials as the redesing PRD version below


This is the redesign PRD version  as mentioned by Alfredo above
http://new.imatrix.com
http://new.imatrix.com/wp-admin
u: health-dev
p: !br4ndsp4$$

We also use jenkins for the deployments to DEV and PRD
Currently Jenkins deployments for this project are not tested, so please dont use them.
Will try to make the DEV jenkins deployment work today

This is the jenkins URL
DEV deployment
http://stg-officite-web1.internetbrands.com:8080/job/imatrixCorp/

PRD deployment
http://stg-officite-web1.internetbrands.com:8080/job/imatrixCorp/

Alfredo will create accounts for you if not created already.

Our working process is usually
LOCAL -> DEV -> PROD
We first make it work on our local environments and then we deploy to the
DEV environment where QA makes sure all is good and if they approve then its deployed to
PRD where QA makes sure again that all is good

You can setup your local environment by getting the code from the git repo above
You will also need to take the DB from the dev server
I just copied it for you on this location
Server: dev-imatrix-web1.internetbrands.com
DB SQL export: /var/www/sites/imatrix-corp-prd/imatrix_corp_prd_17July2017.sql

You will need SSH access for that
